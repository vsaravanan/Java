http://www.raistudies.com/struts-1/dynaactionform-example-with-struts/

In our example, there is a registration form with four fields on which validations are also applied according to the requirement that each and every field is mandatory. The following will be our implementation steps :

First of all, we will configure DynaActionForm as our form bean in struts-config.xml with dynamic properties that will be present in jsp form.
After that we will create our action class (ResigtrationAction.java) and will put validation login in execute method.
Then, we will create the jsp page (Registration.jsp) which will hold our registration form and also show errors occur during form processing. We will also create a success jsp page (Success.jsp) which will be shown to user if there will be no error with the form data provided by the user.
At the last, we will configure our action class in struts-config.xml file.
